# Task7_ML-AL_SVM
I have completed my 7rd task of AI & ML INTERNSHIP of Elevate Lab.In this project worked on a real-world dataset of Breast Cancer .Project focused on detecting breast cancer using the Support vector machine This model was trained on the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which includes features derived from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies: 1)Python 2)Pandas, NumPy 3)Matplotlib 4)Scikit-learn

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding feature distribution and correlation.

ðŸ§¹ Data cleaning and preprocessing, including scaling and label encoding.

ðŸ¤– Implementation of Support vector machine

âœ… Utilized a publicly available breast cancer dataset
âœ… Performed data preprocessing including handling null values and feature scaling
âœ… Trained an SVM classifier with a linear kernel for accurate classification
âœ… Achieved high accuracy in predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign

ðŸ“Š Evaluation metrics like confusion matrix and classification report helped validate the model's performance.

ðŸ’¡ This project strengthened my understanding of supervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, and real-world healthcare applications of AI.
